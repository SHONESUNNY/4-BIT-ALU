# 4-BIT-ALU
A CPU consists of three main sections: memory for variables (registers), control circuitry (microcode), and the ALU. 
The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is the part of a CPU that actually does calculations and condition testing.
For example, if you wish to add two binary numbers, it is the ALU that is responsible for producing the result. 
If your program needs to execute some code if two values are equal it is the ALU that performs the comparison
between the values and then sets flags if the condition is met or not.
